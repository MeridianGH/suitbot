# SuitBot

> A lightweight music and general purpose bot, that uses slash commands and buttons to be as user-friendly as possible!

It uses [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) and [Discord Music Player](https://discord-music-player.js.org/) for its main features.

## Availability
I'm currently hosting the bot myself, and it is publicly available with this invite link:

[![invite](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&logo=discord&label=&labelColor=212121&message=Invite&color=212121)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=887122733010411611&permissions=2167425024&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

You can check the current status to the right under `Environments`.

## Running the Bot
You'll need Node.js v16.x and FFmpeg v4.4.\
Installing SuitBot:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/MeridianGH/suitbot.git
cd suitbot
npm install
```
Rename `config_example.json` to `config.json` and replace the placeholders inside with your info:
- A Discord Bot Token (**[Guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot)**)
- Your Application ID which you can find the the `General Information` tab in your Discord application.
- The Guild ID of the server in which you want to test the bot. To get this ID, activate `Developer Mode` in Discord's options and right-click your server.

Use `node deploy-commands.js` to update and add commands in the guild you specified and `node deploy-commands-global.js` to update the commands in every guild the bot is in.\
Guild commands are refreshed instantly while global commands can take up to an hour.

Start the bot with
```shell
node main.js
```

### Heroku
It is also possible to install and run the bot in Heroku.\
Add your fork of this repository as a GitHub source, add the buildpacks listed below and place your bot token as `token`in the config vars.
```
heroku/nodejs
https://github.com/jonathanong/heroku-buildpack-ffmpeg-latest
```

Make sure to deploy your commands using `node deploy-commands.js` or `node deploy-commands-global.js` when developing new commands before running the bot, as both those files can not be executed on Heroku.
